Using the man pages for the du,sort, and head commands as references, write a script that determines which 10 home directories are the largest on the system. Schedule the script to run every Monday night at 12:00 a.m.and have it mail its output to you. Hint: youâ€™ll want to use a reverse nu-meric sort. (Requires root access.)

du - estimate file space usage
sort - sort lines of text files
head - output the first part of files
